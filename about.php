    <p>Finit Clothing is a little brand that based its success in custom socks for those who need to be unique from head to toe.  This tight knit team came together in a lab room at UCF in the midst of an eCommerce project.  When this five piece realized they shared an affinity for quality, custom socks they knew right away which direction their project was headed.</p>

Whether one is looking for a hot pair of foot swag to tie a great outfit together or a passionate team of 20 to 30 something designers and developers to construct a full user experience, Finit is in for the win.</p>
